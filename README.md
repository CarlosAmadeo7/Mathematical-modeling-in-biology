# Mathematical modeling in biology
1. This repository is dedicated to the marvelous world of mathematics and its influence on the field of Biology.
2. Mathematical modeling is a process by which a mathematical formulation describes a real-world problem.
3. As a master's student interested in mathematical modeling, I understand how modeling different biological systems can be challenging but truly useful.
4. I intend to show simple computational implementations where ODEs, agent-based models, and so on, are applied in the investigation of multiple biological phenomena in molecular biology, gene expression, etc.
5. Information related to each topic can be found inside the Jupyter notebooks.
