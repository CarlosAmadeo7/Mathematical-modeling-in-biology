# Mathematical modeling in biology
## Description
1. This repository is dedicated to the marvelous world of mathematics and its influence on the field of Biology.
2. Mathematical modeling is a process by which a mathematical formulation describes a real-world problem.
3. As a master's student interested in mathematical modeling, I understand how modeling different biological systems can be challenging but truly useful.
4. I intend to show simple computational implementations where ODEs, agent-based models, etc. are applied in the investigation of multiple biological phenomena in molecular biology, gene expression, etc.
5. The repository contains 3 folders: Scripts, Results, and plots.
6. The Scripts folder stores all the custom design scripts and information related to each biological topic, the Results folder contains the output/data of the scripts, and the Plots folder contains any images generated from the scripts commands.
